REPO NOTE: The purpose of this repository / project was decided upon recently
when working on another project and creating these scripts for using while
working on that project and then coming to the conclusion, hey, this would be
helpful for myself and or anyone else that wanted a basic "fly / preview cam"
say for usage when creating and or distributing assets like terrain demos or
other such assets that do not have say an included character controller or
would not need one but would need some type of preview camera to view the
demo content in asset or what not, thus upon considering such it was decided
to add this repository for such...
